# Sugeeth Shortcuts
The main hub of my iOS, iPadOS and macOS shortcut sub-projects.

The idea for this website is to provide API services for my shortcuts, however I'm clearly not good at this stuff.
I will work on it soon. Until then, here are my shortcuts!

1. Spring Lock at (https://routinehub.co/shortcut/8552/)
2. Ultimate Updater at (https://routinehub.co/shortcut/8666/)
3. Go Academic! (Beta) at (https://routinehub.co/shortcut/8670/)

And yeah, that's it as of now.
